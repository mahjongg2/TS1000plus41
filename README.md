# TS1000plus41
A clone of the American version of the ZX-81, the TS1000

This is the American version of the ZX81+38 (revision 1.10), except that the video output jack has been moved to the location where the TS1000 has its RF output jack, this means that this PCB will fit into the enclosure of a TS1000.
te file TS1000plus41.pdf is the schematic, which is nearly identical to the schematic of the ZX81+38 (revision 1.10) except that JP4 is bridged so that the computer default to generating NTSC (60Hz) video, note that this makes the TS1000 slower as it needs to use more CPU cycles for a 60Hz picture, if you have a TV that can display PAL, I suggest scratching the trace on the solderside of JP4 so that 50Hz is restored.
You can solder a jumper in JP4 if you want (after scratching though the trace.
